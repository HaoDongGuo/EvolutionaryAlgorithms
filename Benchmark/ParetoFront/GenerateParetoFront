# DTLZ
DTLZ1-7 have the formula of the optimal pareto front, we can sample the front.

# WFG
  WFG3-9 have the formula of the optimal pareto front, we can sample the front.
  WFG1-2 don't have the formula, we can only use the running method to get the front, 
but in this way we can't get the evenly distributed points. Or we can use the know pareto set to get the front.
