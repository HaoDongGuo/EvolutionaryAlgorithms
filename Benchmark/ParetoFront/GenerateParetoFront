# DTLZ
DTLZ1-7 have the formula of the optimal pareto front, we can sample the front.

# WFG
  WFG3-9 have the formula of the optimal pareto front, we can sample the front.
  WFG1-2 don't have the formula, we can only use the running method to get the front, 
but in this way we can't get the evenly distributed points. Or we can use the know pareto set to get the front.

# DTLZ7
根据最优PF表达式生成的解含有被支配的解，将支配解过滤掉；
已经解决！
# WFG
研究MOEA对于生成WFG问题的运行方法，生成合适的高维目标的PF数据！
对于高维目标，需要适配参数：终止条件。
