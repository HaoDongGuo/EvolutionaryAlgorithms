# EvolutionaryAlgorithms Benchmark Problems' Optimal Pareto Front

# DTLZ7 Pareto Front Generating Method

# WFG1 Pareto Front Generating Method

# WFG2 Pareto Front Generating Method

# Method1: According to the formulation of the optimal solution

# Method2: Under the situation of given Pareto Set, according to the function get the Pareto Front

# Method3: Run exited method to get many near optimal Pareto Front, use the diversity metric to filter the results to get enough Front
